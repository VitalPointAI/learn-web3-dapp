## ðŸ¤” What's The Graph for NEAR?

You might have already read about The Graph or even completed The Graph learning pathway for Ethereum and want to roll up your sleeves and get started coding subgraphs for NEAR, in which case feel free to skip this suggested reading.

If you want to read more about The Graph and it's support for NEAR Protocol we've curated some great resources to help you get started:

- We wrote [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sprngtheory/status/1425137466789486592) to explain The Graph without technical jargon. It's a great place to start!
- Project documentation is not always the best place to start. However, The Graph is an exception. They have very well-written and approachable docs. [Give them a read](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction).
- NEAR support for The Graph is in beta and while many of the concepts are similar to what is required on other chains, it does have nuances of its own. The Graph's docs for [NEAR support](https://thegraph.com/docs/supported-networks/near) are recommended.
- More of a visual learner? The rock star of blockchain Youtube - Finematics - have the perfect video for you: [Binge it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gC7xJ_98r8).
- You're still here?? We have curated more links on [Figment Learn](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/thegraph). Knock yourself out!
